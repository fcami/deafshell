ABOUT

Deaf Shell is intended to be used as a shell for system accounts dedicated to
OpenSSH port forwarding, as in:
ssh -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport]
ssh -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport]
Deaf Shell will print some information and sleep until receiving a termination
signal (Ctrl+C or SIGINT from the user, SIGTERM from the system for instance).
It will also print a character every ten seconds.


FEATURES

* Minimal system resource usage.
* Runs on Linux and probably most other Unices.
* FLOSS (GPLv3).
